## What Does It Do?

Panek Video Program takes:
- **One image** (your album cover, logo, artwork, photo, etc.)
- **One audio file** (your song, podcast, narration, etc.)

And creates:
- **A high-quality 16:9 MP4 video** ready to upload anywhere

The video automatically scales your image to fit 1920Ã—1080, adds black bars if needed, and syncs the audio perfectly. No video editing experience required!

## Using the Program

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Launch the program**
   - Double-click the AppImage, or
   - Find "Panek Video Program" in your applications menu

2. **Choose your output folder** (optional)
   - Click "Choose Output Folder" to select where your video will be saved
   - By default, it saves to the folder where you launched the program

3. **Set a title** (optional)
   - Type a name for your video in the title field
   - If you leave it blank, the program will auto-generate a name with the date and time
   - Example: `my-awesome-song` becomes `my-awesome-song.mp4`

4. **Choose your image**
   - Click "Choose Image"
   - Select your JPG, PNG, or WEBP file
   - **Tip:** 16:9 images (1920Ã—1080, 1280Ã—720, etc.) work best and won't have black bars

5. **Choose your audio**
   - Click "Choose Audio"
   - Select your MP3 or WAV file
   - The video length will match your audio length exactly

6. **Click "Render Video"**
   - The button turns green when you're ready
   - You'll see a progress bar as the video is created
   - This can take a few seconds to several minutes depending on audio length

**New in v2.0:** If a file with the same name already exists, the program will ask if you want to overwrite it. Choose "Yes" to replace it or "No" to cancel and choose a different name.

7. **Done!**
   - A popup will show you where your video was saved
   - You can render another video or close the program

## Tips for Best Results

### Image Tips
- **Use 16:9 aspect ratio** images when possible (1920Ã—1080 is perfect)
- Square images will get black bars on the sides
- Vertical images will get black bars on the top and bottom
- High resolution images work great â€“ the program will scale them properly
- Supported formats: JPG, JPEG, PNG, WEBP

### Audio Tips
- Both MP3 and WAV files work perfectly
- The final video will be exactly as long as your audio
- Audio is converted to AAC format at 192kbps for compatibility
- Any sample rate or bitrate will work

### File Naming
- Avoid special characters in your title (like `/ \ : * ? " < > |`)
- The program will automatically clean up problematic characters
- Spaces are fine and will be preserved

### "ffmpeg not found" Error
**Problem:** The program can't find FFmpeg on your system.

**Solution:**
1. Install FFmpeg using the instructions in the Installation section
2. Restart the program after installing FFmpeg

### Video Won't Play on Some Devices
**Problem:** Video plays on computer but not on phone or TV.

**Solution:** This shouldn't happen with Panek Video Program â€“ it creates highly compatible MP4 files. If you encounter this, please report it as a bug.

### Render Button Stays Gray
**Problem:** Can't click the Render button.

**Solution:**
- Make sure you've selected both an image AND an audio file
- Both labels should show file paths, not "not selected"
- The button will turn green when both files are chosen

### Program Crashes or Freezes
**Problem:** Program stops responding during render.

**Solution:**
1. Check if FFmpeg is still running (look in System Monitor/Activity Monitor)
2. Very long audio files (hours) may take significant time
3. Try with a shorter audio clip first to test
4. Check the log window at the bottom for error messages

### AppImage Won't Launch (Linux)
**Problem:** Double-clicking does nothing.

**Solution:**
1. Make sure the file is executable (right-click â†’ Properties â†’ Permissions)
2. Install `libfuse2`: `sudo apt install libfuse2`
3. Try running from terminal to see error messages:
   ```bash
   ./PanekVideoProgram-x86_64.AppImage
   ```
